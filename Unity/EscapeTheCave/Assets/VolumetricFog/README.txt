Updating from earlier versions
------------------------------

If you're updating from v7.5 or earlier, please note that this update introduces new options regarding transparency support.
Also make sure you uncheck unused shader features clicking on the "Shader Options" button at top of Volumetric Fog & Mist inspector.


How to use this asset
---------------------
Firstly, you should run the Demo Scenes provided to get an idea of the overall functionality. There're lot of use cases where you can use Volumetric Fog & Mist, from gorgeous thick animated smoke, to thin mist above grass, dense dust storms, ...
Later, you should read the documentation and experiment with the tool.

Hint: to quick start using the asset just add VolumetricFog script to your camera. It will show up in the Game view. Customize it using the custom inspector.


Demo Scenes
-----------
There're 10+ demo scenes, located in "Demos" folder. Just go there from Unity, open them and run it. Remember to remove the Demos folder from your project to reduce size.


Documentation/API reference
---------------------------
The PDF is located in the Documentation folder. It contains instructions on how to use this asset as well as a useful Frequent Asked Question section.


Support
-------
Please read the documentation PDF and browse/play with the demo scenes and sample source code included before contacting us for support :-)

Future updates
--------------

All our assets follow an incremental development process by which a few beta releases are published on our support forum (kronnect.com).
We encourage you to signup and engage our forum. The forum is the primary support and feature discussions medium.

Of course, all updates of Volumetric Fog & Mist will be eventually available on the Asset Store.
