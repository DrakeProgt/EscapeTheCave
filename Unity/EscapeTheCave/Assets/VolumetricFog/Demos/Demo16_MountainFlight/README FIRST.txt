This demo scene "MountainFlight" uses the awesome "Autumn Mountain" free package.
Due to Unity Asset Store EULA, it's not allowed to include free assets in other packages hence you need to import it manually.

Steps:

1) Import Autumn Mointain from the Asset Store here:

2) Open "MountainScene" and enjoy it.
